Food Delivery App

Welcome to the Food Delivery App! This application offers users an intuitive platform to browse a variety of food items, place orders, and securely process payments. Built with modern web technologies, the app ensures a seamless user experience. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and React JS, while the backend is powered by Node JS and Express JS, with MongoDB as the database for storing data. Payment processing is handled through Stripe, providing a secure and efficient transaction process.

To get started with the Food Delivery App, ensure you have Node.js, npm, and MongoDB installed on your machine. Clone the repository from GitHub and install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend. You'll need to set up environment variables in the backend, including your MongoDB connection string, JWT secret key, and Stripe secret key. After setting up, you can run the backend and frontend servers to start the application.

Once the app is running, users can register or log in, browse available food items, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The app also features real-time order tracking. An admin dashboard is available for managing food items and orders. The backend provides several API endpoints for user authentication, food item management, and order processing.
